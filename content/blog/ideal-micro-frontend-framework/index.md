In my experience I found out that the better we understand and describe our problems, the easier it will be for us to figure out the solutions. In this blog, I will attempt to give a desire list of features that I think a microfrontend framework should have, in order for developers to build high performance and scalable web applications. Firstly, let us see what is microfrontend and why do we need them. 

### Microfrontend

Many times I wanted to name my blog as simple programming partly because I want to describe programming concepts using simple terms and words. As the matter of fact, I wouldn't be able to use fancy words anyways as I learned to speak english rather late in my high school years. If you are familiar with microservices, then the microfrontend can easily make sense to you. In a complicated web application, different features e.g. login, search, chat, email...etc can be built as separate modules. These modules are composed and rendered in the same web app. For that type of web app, we can call it microfrontend. 

You might ask the question why do we need to have separate modules in a website. Because microfrontend share much of its advantages with microservices, thus when domain logic is growing and complicated enough, there is a high need to create microfrontend website to boost development velocity as well as maintaining high quality web app.

### New features as frontend module

Almost nobody will start off developing a microfrontend website. The requirement comes only when the business is big enough to have huge codebase of the webapp. Then at that point, building a microfrontend website is usually a task that needs developer to build a new and independent module for the existing website.
