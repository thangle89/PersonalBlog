In my experience I found out that the better we understand and describe our problems, the easier it will be for us to figure out the solutions. In this blog, I will attempt to give a desire list of features that I think a microfrontend framework should have, in order for developers to build high performance and scalable web applications. Firstly, let us see what is microfrontend and why do we need them. 

### Microfrontend

### New features as frontend module

### Architecture

### Development

### Testing

### Deployment
