At the start of software developer career, most programmers focus on learning technologies, algorithms, languages...etc, to be able to land a good job. At some points later, there will be need to design applications from scratch. That raises a question within me: `"How ones can design and build a highly scalable applications"`. Reading a few books on the subject will sure get you realized that: there is not many innovative architectures in software engineering that you couldn't grasp onto. In this blog I want to highlight a couple of important aspects: architecture, testing and monitoring in the development process. 

### What makes a sound architecture

### The hardship of testing microservices

### What to monitor

### Final thoughts
