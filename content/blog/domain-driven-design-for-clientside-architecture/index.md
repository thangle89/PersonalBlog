### Introduction

Clientside development is getting more and more complex ever as the number of frameworks and libraries increase. Especially with applications that need to interact with multiple domains. For example at Agoda (which is my current company), it contains both hotels, homes, flights and packages. The clientside codebase of these applications are huge. Recently I grew interest on the topic and want to dive deeper into it. 

The problem in big applications with multiple domains is that it is very easy to add complexity into the growing application. If not careful, it will be unmanagable at some point. In my opinion, we can prevent the problem with good architecture and right structure of the codebase. It is not a new idea to apply Domain driven design (DDD) to clientside, just that there are not many dicussion on the topic in the community. We can only find the best solution if more people talk and discuss it. In this post, I will offer my view on how we can apply DDD to structure clientside codebase.
